# GameMaker
Python Script to run games from a YML file

This is not a good programming style... I know.....
I did this a few hours.


To play, download and execute "setupGameMaker.py". It will download ad set up the required libraries, and create a "launcher.py".

The program files will be downloaded to %appdata%/.GameMaker
